# Introduction

This was a live demo used for my conference talk [Node.js mini projects](https://umaar.github.io/node-mini-projects-talk/index.html#/). It uses [demokit](https://github.com/runkitdev/demokit) to navigate through the ScotlandJS 2018 site while recording the interaction. You can also view the video file: `video 2018-07-25 at 6.11.30 PM.mov` to see the recorded interaction.

# To Run
